    <string name="superman_step_3">Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower your legs and arms back to your starting position without any movement in your low back or hips.  </string>
    <string name="push_up_step_3">Downward Phase: Slowly bend the elbows, lowering your body toward the floor. Keep the torso rigid and the head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or ribcage to sag or your hips to hike upward. Engage your butt (glutes) and thigh (quadriceps) muscles to help maintain stability and a rigid body. Try to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should stay close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.   </string>
    <string name="contralateral_limb_raises_step_3">Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower your arm back towards your starting position without any movement in your low back or hips.</string>
    <string name="bent_knee_push_up_step_3">Downward Phase: Keeping the torso rigid and head aligned with your spine, slowly bend your elbows and lower your body toward the floor. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upward. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly.</string>

    <string name="bent_knee_sit_up_step_3">NO data available</string>
    <string name="push_up_with_single_leg_raise_step_3">Downward Phase: Slowly bend the elbows, lowering your body toward the floor. Keep the torso rigid and the head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back or ribcage to sag or your hips to hike upward. Engage your glutes (butt) and quadriceps (thigh) muscles to help maintain stability and a rigid body. Try to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or be allowed to flare outwards slightly.</string>
    <string name="front_plank_step_3">Downward Phase: Keep the torso and legs stiff as you slowly and gently lower your body back towards the mat or floor. If you experience any pain in the low back with this movement, stop the exercise immediately and consult with your doctor.   For professional guidance in your exercise program, find an ACE-certified Personal Trainer in your area. Before beginning any fitness program, always see a qualified healthcare provider for advice and to address any questions or concerns. The exercises presented on this website are for suggestion only and should not be substituted for medical diagnosis or treatment. Participate at your own risk and stop if you feel faint or experience shortness of breath.</string>
    <string name="side_plank_with_bent_knee_step_3">NO data available</string>
    <string name="supine_reverse_crunches_step_3">Downward Phase: Gently inhale. With control, lower your spine and hips back to the start position. Proper form is important when performing this exercise to prevent excessive stress on your low back. When returning to your starting position during the repetitions, control your leg movement. Do not allow your knees to move past your hips, but instead return to a position directly above your hips. Since the abdominals connect the rib cage to the pelvis, the emphasis of the movement should be on pulling your pelvis upwards towards your rib cage.</string>
    <string name="cobra_step_3">Downward Phase: Gently lower your upper body back to the mat or floor, lengthening the spine as you descend.</string>
    <string name="squat_jumps_step_3">Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode up through your lower body, fully extending your hips, knees and ankles. As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.Try to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling into the heels. Always push your hips back and down to absorb the impact of landing. Do not lock out your knees on your landing.</string>
    <string name="forward_lunge_step_3">As you step forward into the lunge, focus on a downward movement of your hips toward the floor. Avoid driving your hips forward. This will help control the forward movement of your shinbone over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your shinbone is in a slight forward lean. During the movement, slightly bend forward at your hips. Keep the back straight.</string>
    <string name="forward_lunge_with_arm_drivers_step_3">As you lunge forward, focus on dropping your hips downward toward the floor rather than forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your shinbone is in a slight forward lean. As you lunge, bend forward at your hips, reach your arms toward the floor in front of you. Keep your back flat and elbows straight. Your hands are reaching to a point somewhat below your front knee. This increases the load on your gluteal (butt) muscle group.</string>
    <string name="glute_activation_lunges_step_3">As you lunge, rotate your arms and torso in the opposite direction of the lunge movement. This increases the load on your glute muscle group. Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your thighs and butt muscles to return to your upright, starting position.</string>
    <string name="glute_bridge_step_3">Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back to your starting position.</string>
    <string name="hip_rotations_step_3">Rotational Movement: Exhale and gently draw one knee up toward its corresponding armpit. Do NOT allow your hips and low back to pitch upwards or sag down towards the floor.</string>
    <string name="side_lunge_step_3">Exhale and push off firmly with your right foot, returning to starting position. Repeat the movement for the opposite side.  Exercise variation: Reaching for your right foot with your left hand will emphasize hip flexion (alternate with the right hand reaching for the left foot).</string>
    <string name="side_lying_hip_abduction_step_3">Downward Phase: Gently inhale and return the leg to your starting position in a slow, controlled manner. After completing your set, roll over and repeat with the opposite leg.</string>
    <string name="side_lying_hip_adduction_step_3">Downward Phase: Gently inhale and return the leg to your starting position in a slow, controlled manner. After completing your set, roll over and repeat with the opposite leg.</string>
    <string name="side_plank_step_3">Lowering Phase: Inhale and gently return yourself to your starting position. After a prescribed number of repetitions, repeat on the other side.</string>
    <string name="side_plank_with_straight_leg_step_3">Lowering Phase: Inhale and gently return to your starting position. After a prescribed number of repetitions, repeat on the other side.</string>
    <string name="single_leg_stand_step_3">Exercise Variation: Increase the intensity of this exercise by going through the following progressions (1) lift the one leg higher off the floor (illustrated) to further raise your center of mass, (2)raise both arms overhead (3) lift one arm to your side, (4) tilt your head, (5) close your eyes then finally (6) close your eyes and tilt your head.</string>
    <string name="standing_calf_raises_wall_step_3">Downward Phase: Inhale and slowly lower your heels back to the floor.Exercise Variation (1): Single-leg Calf Raise: From your starting position, bend your left knee to lift your left foot off the floor. Perform single-leg calf raises. Repeat with your right leg.</string>
    <string name="supine_pelvic_tilts_step_3">Upward Phase: Inhale. Tip your pelvis in the opposite direction creating an arch in your low back/increasing the space between the low back and the mat. Do not lift your hips or let your tailbone roll up off the floor Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position.</string>


    <string name="superman_step_4">keep practising.</string>
    <string name="push_up_step_4">Upward Phase: Press upward through your arms, straightening the elbows. Keep the torso rigid and head aligned with your spine. Imagine pushing the floor away from you. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upward. An alternative position is to keep your fingers facing forward and your elbows close to your sides during the downward phase. This shifts the emphasis from the chest muscles onto the triceps and may reduce stresses in the shoulder joint.  Pushing through the outside surface and heel of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.</string>
    <string name="contralateral_limb_raises_step_4">Exercise Variation (1): From your starting position, deepen your abdominal and core muscles to stabilize your spine and slowly stretch leg out and allow the leg to lift off of the floor. Keep your leg straight and your toes reaching to the wall behind you. Keep both hip bones and pubic bone in contact with the mat. Avoiding any rotation in your leg or pelvis. Your head and torso should not move, avoiding any arching in your back. Do not lift your chin or lower your head. Hold this position briefly. Return to your starting position.</string>
    <string name="bent_knee_push_up_step_4">Upward Phase: Maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine, press upward through your arms. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upward. Continue pressing until the elbows are straight. Push-ups place stress upon the wrist joints. To alleviate some of this stress you may opt to use dumbbells and grip the handles rather than place your hands on the floor. If your are pressing from an elevation such as a dumbbell, you do not need to lower your chest or chin to the floor, but rather lower yourself until your chest or chin are level with the dumbbell handles.</string>

    <string name="bent_knee_sit_up_step_4">NO data available</string>
    <string name="push_up_with_single_leg_raise_step_4">Upward Phase: Straighten the elbows, pressing upward through your arms. Keep the torso rigid and head aligned with your spine. As you straighten the arms, lift your left foot off the floor, keeping the knee straight. Do not allow the hips to rotate as you raise the leg off the floor. Do not allow your low back or ribcage to sag or your hips to hike upward. Continue pressing until the elbows are straight and your left leg is off the floor. Hold this position briefly before returning to your starting position. Repeat the push up alternating legs with each repetition.  Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.</string>

    <string name="cobra_step_4">If you experience any pain in the low back with this movement, stop the exercise immediately and consult with your doctor. As the length of arms differ, individuals may often lift their hips off the mat or floor as they fully extend their arms. In this case, limit the extension in your arms to keep the hips on the mat.</string>
    <string name="forward_lunge_step_4">Firmly push off with the front leg, activating both your thighs and butt muscles to return to your upright, starting position. We suggest you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground before performing this forward lunge. Once you master the forward lunge, you can progress to doing a lunge using arm drivers and multi-directional glute activation lunges.</string>
    <string name="forward_lunge_with_arm_drivers_step_4">Firmly push off with your front leg, working your thigh and butt muscles, to return to your upright, starting position.  It is suggested, you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and forward lunges before progressing to using arm drivers.</string>
    <string name="glute_activation_lunges_step_4">This series of multi-directional (multi-planar) lunges are intended to activate your glutes, which protect your knee during walking, running and jumping-type activities. As many of us have weak glutes, this exercise can be performed as part of your pre-exercise warm-up. Given the moderate degree of complexity of the three movements, we recommend learning this exercise first without your arms and only progress to the arm drivers as you feel comfortable. It is suggested you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground and forward lunges before performing these glute activation lunges.</string>
    <string name="glute_bridge_step_4">Progression: Gradually progress this exercise by starting with both feet together and extending one leg while in the raised position. Avoid arching your low back as you press your hips upward, which normally occurs if you attempt to push your hips as high as possible. This can be achieved by contracting your abdominal muscles prior to lifting, and keeping them engaged throughout the lift</string>
    <string name="hip_rotations_step_4">In this knee-tuck position, rotate your hips to move your bent knee across the front of your torso toward its opposite armpit. Do not hike or drop your hips. Continue to move until your hips cannot rotate any further. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise. Pause very briefly.Rotate the hip in the opposite direction (away from your torso), until your hips cannot rotate any further without movement in your spine. Your bent knee is pointing away from your body. Your head and shoulder should remain level throughout the exercise.</string>
    <string name="side_lunge_step_4">A common mistake when performing a side lunge is that individuals often step too wide and are unable to align the shinbone over the placed foot and the knee falls inside the foot. In this case, simply take a smaller step to allow you to align the shinbone over the placed foot.</string>
    <string name="side_lying_hip_abduction_step_4">A common mistake is raising the leg too high in this exercise. Given the design of the hip joint, the thigh can only abduct (move out sideways) to 45 degrees. Any movement beyond that position involves movement of the entire hip and no longer targets the muscles intended for this exercise.</string>
    <string name="side_lying_hip_adduction_step_4">Due to the limited movement at the hip joint in this direction, the leg need only rise a few inches off the mat/floor.  </string>
    <string name="side_plank_step_4">Exercise Variation: You can increase the exercise intensity by increasing the length of time you are in the raised position.</string>
    <string name="side_plank_with_straight_leg_step_4">Exercise Variation: You can increase the intensity of this exercise by (1) increasing the length of time you are in the raised position, (2) raising the upper leg off the lower leg or (3) raising the lower leg off the floor and maintaining contact with your elbow and the foot of the upper leg only. When raising the upper leg off the lower leg, there is no need to raise it to a level beyond parallel with the floor.</string>
    <string name="single_leg_stand_step_4">Try to perform this exercise in front of a mirror initially so that you can watch and control the degree sideways shift over the standing leg. Always try to minimize the shifting the hips as it places excessive stress on your knee joint. While balancing on the standing leg, think about pressing your foot into the floor and squeezing your glutes (butt muscles), this will help reduce any sideways tilting.  Most of us can lift one leg, but the question of the quality of movement is important. Perform your movements slowly and under control, avoiding any sudden positional changes. Perform each progression until you can execute them with good control and form.</string>
    <string name="standing_calf_raises_wall_step_4">Exercise Variation (2): Modified Internal and External Foot Position: Turn your feet inward (to 10 and 2 o\'clock ) or turn your feet outward (to the same clock positions) and perform your calf raises with both feet or with a single leg. Turning your feet inward places more emphasis on the medial (inner) muscles while turning your feet outward places more emphasis on the lateral (outer) muscles.  The gastrocnemius (major calf muscle) contains a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers thus is better suited to more explosive training. Therefore, once you have mastered your technique these raises can be performed more explosively (with greater power and force) so you can gain greater benefits from the exercise.</string>

    <string name="contralateral_limb_raises_step_5">Exercise Variation (2): From your starting position, deepen your abdominal/core muscles to stabilize your spine. Reach one leg out and way until it lifts off the floor. At the same time float the opposite arm a few inches off the floor. Keep both your leg and arm straight and avoid any rotation in either. Your head and torso should not move, avoiding any arching in your back. Do not lift your chin or lower your head. Hold this position briefly. Return to your starting position.</string>
    <string name="squat_jumps_step_4">Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity, which places additional stress on your knees.Try to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling into the heels. Always push your hips back and down to absorb the impact of landing. Do not lock out your knees on your landing.</string>
